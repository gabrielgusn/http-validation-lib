The File interface provides archives' informations and allows JavaScript to access it's content.

They are usually requested by an object [FileList2](https://developeeer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/FileList) that is returned as a result of the user's selection of archives through the element [<input>](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input), from the object [DataTransfer](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer) used in dragging and releasing operations, or from the API `mozGetAsFile()` in a [HTMLCanvasElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement). In Gecko, scrypts with privileges can create File objects representing any local file without the user's interaction (see [Implementation Notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/File#imprementation_notes) for more information).
